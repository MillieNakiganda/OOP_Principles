 <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
</div>

<p>This is a project that follows OOP Principles to write clean, defended, manageable, maintainable, extensible and testable code</p>

## Getting started

The project was written in C#, so it best navigated using Visual Studio IDE

#### Installation guidelines

- Clone the repository

#### Problem Statement

Build A customer Management System(ACM).

##### Requirements

It should manage business, residential, government and educator types of customers

It should manage products

It must accept orders from customers online or through the call centre

#### Steps taken to come up with the class diagram

- Identify Entities that we can make classes, identify their properties and methods (Abstraction and Encapsulation in mind)

- Seperate Responsibilities to maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. This makes the project easy to maintainin and test.

  Make sure a class is responsible for one task,anything different from that class should be its own class and made a reference

- Establish Relationships between these classes with cardinality in mind incase it is a collaborative relationship

- Leverage re-use to reduce duplication, come up with entity base classes and incase of any commonality among unrelated classes, come up with interfaces
